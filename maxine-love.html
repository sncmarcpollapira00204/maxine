    I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me.
    Being around you makes everything feel lighter, and every conversation,
    laugh, and quiet moment we share is something I truly treasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    So before this day goes any further, I want you to know that it would
    mean a lot to me to spend Valentine’s Day with you.

    Every moment with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. 
    Your smile brightens even my dullest days, and your presence alone makes everything feel lighter and better. 
    Just knowing that I have you gives me a kind of peace I didn’t even realize I needed before, baby.
  </p>

  <p>
    This past year with you has been one of the most meaningful seasons of my life. 
    We’ve faced overthinking, doubts, and challenges, but through it all, we chose each other. 
    And that’s what makes us strong. Loving you isn’t always perfect, but it’s real, and it’s worth everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    I see how hard you try every day for your family, for your dreams, and for all the responsibilities you carry. 
    You’re stronger than you think, baby. Even when you feel overwhelmed, even when your emotions run high, 
    I know how powerful your heart is. Your fire isn’t something I see as negative I see it as passion. 
    It shows how deeply you care, how much you value things, and how fiercely you protect what matters to you. 
    That strength in you is beautiful, and I love that about you.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Valentine’s Day, I just want you to relax and feel how loved you are. 
    Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for loving me.  
    Happy Valentine’s Day, baby. I love you 🤍
  </p>
